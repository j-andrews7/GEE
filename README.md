# Gene Expression Explorer
**GEE** is a Shiny app for interactive exploration and visualization of bulk and scRNA-seq data. It is based on an original prototype by [lhover11](https://github.com/lhover11) and heavily inspired by iSEE.

**GEE** is built upon the unparalleled flexibility of the R/Bioconductor package [dittoSeq](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/dittoSeq.html) to 
provide a convenient avenue for bulk and single-cell RNA-seq figure generation and exploratory data analysis. 

## Current State

This is currently not intended for public use, as it uses datasets stored on our personal RStudio Connect server. In time, a variant of it will likely be added to the dittoSeq package.

However, if you find it useful and utilize it in your research, please cite the dittoSeq publication:
